Issues with the application so far.


1) When adding a new customer to the DB. It should check whether the customer has already stored in the database 
by validating the email address since it is unique.

2) When a page is refreshed, the data from DB should be displayed consistently.

3) When a product goes out of stock. The add to cart button should be disabled and out of stock message should
be displayed.
